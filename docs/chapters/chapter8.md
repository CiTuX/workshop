## App Challenge Part 2 - Master-Detail Pages

With your basic list complete, your next test is to turn your list of pets into a functional master-detail interface.

### What you’re building

The master-detail user interface pattern is a popular way to design mobile applications. Master-detail interfaces work best when you have a large list of some type of data, and the individual items in the list have details associated with them — details that the user needs to view or modify.

The Petfinder API provides exactly this information, so let’s put this user interface into practice with FurFriendster. After you complete this challenge, readers should be able to tap items on the master list of pets, and navigate to a second screen where they can see details about the pet they’re interested in.

Here’s what your master-detail UI might look like after you complete this section.

### Building the page

Talk a little bit about how to approach the problem. Maybe even list the various files the reader will have to touch in order to implement a new route.

### Requirements

List the hard requirements of this challenge. I think we’ll want to tell the reader that they must use at least social share. They must display certain information. That sort of thing.

### Tips

Give a couple of hints. Like:

* Links to the navigation docs.
* Information on how to build that diamond UI with clip-path
