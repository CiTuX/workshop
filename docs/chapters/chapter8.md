## App Challenge Part 3 - Setting up a Form

With a master/detail interface complete, your app is almost ready to go. Your next step is to remove your hardcoded data, and let users filter and find exactly the pet they’re looking for.

### What you’re building

Show a screenshot of the wizard screen, and explain what it’s doing in detail.

### Building the form

Talk to the reader a bit about the problem they need to solve.

Give the reader the hard requirements of the chapter. List all form fields they must offer the reader, and what values to accept for each.

Give a couple of hints. Like:

* Adding the appropriate configuration in your app’s main NgModule.
* Pointing readers at the UI components they’ll need.
