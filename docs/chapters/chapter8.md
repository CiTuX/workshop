## App Challenge Part 2 - Master/Detail Pages

With your basic list complete, your next test is to turn your list of pets into a functional master/detail interface. That is, after you complete this challenge, readers should be able to tap items on the master list, and navigate to a second screen where they can see details about the pet they’re interested in.

* Information on how to build that diamond UI with clip-path
