## App Challenge Part 1 - Build a List

Now that you’ve got the NativeScript basics down, it’s time to put your skills to the test. Your task in the next three chapters is to build an entire NativeScript app from scratch.

### What you’re building

Explain what the user will be building—the whole app.

Show a screenshot of the final list screen specifically and talk about it in a bit of detail.

### Building the list

Tell readers about the backend service we’ve provided, and tell them what method to call in the provided service to get that data they need. Tell the reader to hardcode the data they pass to the service for now, and give them some options for hardcoding.

(This would also be a good idea to give instructions for the offline fallback, in case the internet died down too.)

List the hard requirements of this challenge. Should be pretty simple for this one. Build a list and show the pet’s name? Anything else?

Remind readers how to start new NativeScript apps.

Give a couple of hints. Like:

* Links to the ListView docs
* Make sure to register the new service in your NgModule.
