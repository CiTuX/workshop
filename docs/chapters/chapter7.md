## SUPER ULTIMATE CHALLENGE

Itâ€™s the end of the day, therefore youâ€™re more ready than ever for the SUPER MEGA ULTIMATE CHALLENGE. Thatâ€™s right, get ready to test your NativeScript skills against the biggest and baddest data form that we can reaslistically tackle in an hour. Get pumped.

### Whatâ€™s the challenge?

Your challenge, should you choose to accept it, is to build a form that collects four pieces of information from the user: a name, an email address, a date of birth, and whether theyâ€™d like to sign up for a newsletter. Youâ€™re welcome to design this form however youâ€™d like, and you totally might want to use the [new NativeScript theme](https://docs.nativescript.org/ui/theme), but hereâ€™s one lackluster UI you can try to replicate:

<img src="images/ios-form.png" style="height: 450px; border: 0;">
<img src="images/android-form.png" style="height: 450px; border: 0;">

The form should send a POST request to the following endpoint:

```
https://api.everlive.com/v1/GWfRtXi1Lwt4jcqK/Accounts
```

The body of the request should be a JSON stringified object that has the following four keys: `Name`, `Email`, `DOB`, and `Newsletter`. (Donâ€™t worry about the specific formatting of the individual paramters; aka, send an date format youâ€™d like for `DOB`, and any boolean format youâ€™d like for `Newsletter`.)

Thereâ€™s a simple listing of all data that has come through hosted at <https://jsfiddle.net/dLvz083w/>. If you see your data on this list youâ€™ve completed the challenge successfully.

And if you finish, there are some super special [bonus challenges](#chapter7.3) for you to tackle.

### Starting up the challenge

<h4 class="exercise-start">
    <b>Exercise</b>: Start up a new app
</h4>

Every good challenge starts with a new app. For this challenge go ahead and start a new blank project with the `tns create` command.

```
tns create CHALLENGE --ng
```

Next, change directories into your new project:

```
cd CHALLENGE
```

After that, open your `main.ts` file and replace its contents with the code below, as youâ€™ll be needing both the `NativeScriptFormsModule` and `NativeScriptHttpModule` to complete this challenge.

``` TypeScript
import { platformNativeScriptDynamic, NativeScriptModule } from "nativescript-angular/platform";
import { NativeScriptFormsModule } from "nativescript-angular/forms";
import { NativeScriptHttpModule } from "nativescript-angular/http";
import { NgModule } from "@angular/core";
import { AppComponent } from "./app.component";

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent],
  imports: [
    NativeScriptModule,
    NativeScriptFormsModule,
    NativeScriptHttpModule
  ]
})
class AppComponentModule {}

platformNativeScriptDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppComponentModule);
```

Finally, create a `account.service.ts` file in your `app` folder and paste in the following code. Youâ€™ll need this service to hit this challengeâ€™s backend that weâ€™ll discuss momentarily. Youâ€™ll have to figure out how to use this service like you did in [chapter 4.0](#chapter4.0). 

``` TypeScript
import { Injectable } from "@angular/core";
import { Http, Headers } from "@angular/http";
import { Observable } from "rxjs/Rx";
import "rxjs/add/operator/catch";
import "rxjs/add/operator/map";
import { Account } from "./account";

@Injectable()
export class AccountService {
  constructor(private http: Http) {}

  add(account: Account) {
    let headers = new Headers();
    headers.append("Content-Type", "application/json");

    return this.http.post(
      "https://api.everlive.com/v1/GWfRtXi1Lwt4jcqK/Accounts",
      JSON.stringify({
        "Name": account.name,
        "Email": account.email,
        "DOB": account.dob,
        "Newsletter": account.newsletter
      }),
      { headers: headers }
    )
    .catch((error) => {
      console.log(error);
      return Observable.throw(error);
    })
  }
}
```

<div class="exercise-end"></div>

And with that, youâ€™re ready to get started.

### Tips to help you out

Below youâ€™ll find a few tips if you find yourself getting stuck, and a few suggestions for how you improve this little app if you have some extra time. Towards the end of the hour weâ€™ll share a full solution that you can refer to later.

<h4 class="exercise-start">
    <b>Exercise</b>: TIPS
</h4>

Stuck? Here are a few tips that might help you get this form up and running.

<div class="solution-start"></div>

* **Tip #1**: You can use `[(ngModel)]` to bind to `<TextField>`, `<DatePicker>`, and `<Switch>` UI components. Youâ€™re going to want to use something like this:

``` XML
<TextField [(ngModel)]="account.name"></TextField>
<DatePicker [(ngModel)]="account.dob"></DatePicker>
<Switch [(ngModel)]="account.newsletter"></Switch>
```

* **Tip #2**: You can create a divider in your UI with the following bit of XML and CSS.

``` XML
<StackLayout class="divider"></StackLayout>
```

``` CSS
.divider {
  height: 1;
  background-color: black;
  margin-top: 20;
  margin-bottom: 20;
}
```

### Bonus challenges!

Finish the challenge? Most excellent. But wait, thereâ€™s more! Here are some ways you can improve this form. See how many of these things you can finish in an hour.

- While saving the form disable all form fields so the user cannot interact with them. Hint: You can bind to the `isEnabled` property that all form fields have.
- Show an activity indicator while the form is submitting. Thereâ€™s a handy [ActivityIndicator UI component](https://docs.nativescript.org/angular/code-samples/activity-indicator.html) thatâ€™ll work nicely for this.
- Show an alert after the form successfully submits, and also when something goes wrong. Refer to the [dialogs module](https://docs.nativescript.org/angular/ui/dialogs.html) for more information.
- Donâ€™t allow the user to submit with an empty name or email. Show an alert, or even find a more custom way to display an error message on your form.

And thatâ€™s it. When youâ€™re done make sure to show us how far you made it ðŸ˜€
